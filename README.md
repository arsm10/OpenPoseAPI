# OpenPoseAPI
In this project the OpenPose API is used by using C++. The Human motion is captured by a Mobile camera. The OpenPose repository is extracting from https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose.git.</br>
The human skeleton is detected and extracting 2D points of the human skeletons in "Image Co-ordinates". The co-ordinates are further used for the joint angle calculations. I integrate this API with my JointAngle() function which can calculate the angle between the bpdy joints.</br>
The following enviroment is used to build the OpenPose API.
- Visual Studio 2017
- OpenCV 4.2.0 https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
# Build OpenPose
The following steps are used to build the OpenPose.
- The extracting OpenPose repository is build by using CMake
- After successfully build, Goto the "build Folder" and open OpenPose.sln
- "Solution Explorer" is on the right side of the Visual Studio window. Click on "Examples", then "Tuturial" and then "C++ API".
- In "C++ API", there are severals example. This projects use "03_keypoints_from_image". Right click on the "03_keypoints_from_image" and made it "Set as Startup Project".
# Results
- Extracts the Joint Point with its coresponding Joint Name and save it into .csv file
- Calculate the Joint Angles and save these angles into .csv file
